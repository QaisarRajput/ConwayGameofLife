# Conway's Game of Life
An interesting look at how complexity can emerge from merely simple set of rules

Its just something i was curious and fasinated about. If you are too, please watch what video is [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8kUJL04ELA]

I tried many rules, following is the unique output i got from it.

## Installation
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run
#### `GameOfLife.py`.
Configure the rule and visualize the results. It will also save the screens in Images folder

#### `ImageToVideoMaker.py`
This converts the images into video. See the `sample.avi`
